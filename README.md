# Flash_Card_App
This project is another continuation of learning using Python, Tkinter, and interacting with files.

Concepts practicing:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- File handling
- Tkinter GUI Development
- Tkinter grid layout management
- Event handling in Tkinter
- Tkinter widgets (Labels, Buttons, Entry)
- Tkinter canvas for images used
- error exceptions handling (try, except, finally, raise, if/else)

This is a simple flash card application that allows users to create, view, and manage flash cards. Users will be able to study different language vocabularies by creating flash cards with a word and its definition. The application will allow users to add new cards.

## Features
- flash card front - word
- flash card back - definition
- ability to add new flash cards
- save progress
- flash card "flip" functionality (note: this is not a real flip, but a change of text)
- two buttons for navigation: "Next" and "Previous"
